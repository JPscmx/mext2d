# Random Forest Classification

Classifiers were trained to classify patients as Type 2 Diabetes, Impaired Glucose Tolerance, and Normal Glucose Tolerance as determined by WHO guidelines. Classifiers were trained on 16S data collapsed to four different levels:
- variants (DESeq normalized counts)
- genera (DESeq normalized counts)
- family (relative abundance)
- SparCC clusters (relative abundance)

I'd like to standardize the data fed into the classifier better later.
